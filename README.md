* For the desktop layout (screen width â‰¥768px):
  * Hamburger icon should not be visible
  * All navigation items should be displayed (`.nav-items` container should have `max-height: 0`)
  * All navigation items should be positions horizontally
* For the mobile layout (screen width <768px):
  * Hamburger icon should be visible
  * When hamburger icon is hovered, it should not have underlining decoration
  * All navigation items should not be initially displayed
  * Navigation items should be shown when user clicks on a hamburger icon (functionality already provided)
  * All navigation items should be positions vertically
  * All navigation items should be centered
